 Celeste code mod with any things I create. You can download the mod at gamebanana [here!](https://gamebanana.com/mods/424032)

Note, I made the decision not to release Ahorn plugins for the mod on Gamebanana so that I can develop faster. I also made this decision so that you are more likely to use Lönn, as hopefully it will fully replace Ahorn someday!

## Issue Reporting
 If you find bugs, create a new issue or a pull request to let me know, or fix it yourself.

# Changelog
## Version 1.2.1 - Minor update
### Features:
 - Invert Stamina on Dash Trigger - a requested feature, which gives the player funky stamina!

# Changelog
## Version 1.1 - An effect ported from Strawberry Jam!
#### Features:
 - Added Linked Temple Gates - they only work alongside the Linked Dash Switches, and are designed to make their use more intuitive!
 - Added Meteor Shower effect - you'll recognize this from Strawberry Jam! It works based on frequency rather than count, so is more robust. In the future I'll add a trigger to update this frequency during gameplay.
#### Breaking Change:
 - Linked Dash Switches no longer work with default temple gates so as to make behavior easier to predict.
